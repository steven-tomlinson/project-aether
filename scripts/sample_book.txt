The Red Dust of Mars

The wind howled across the crimson plains, carrying with it the metallic taste of oxidized iron. Kael adjusted his respirator, the hiss of the intake valve the only sound competing with the storm. He wasn't supposed to be out here, not this far from the habitat dome. But the signal had been clear.

"Kael, come in," the comms crackled. It was Mara. Her voice was laced with static, but the panic was unmistakable. "The seismic sensors... they're off the charts. Something is moving underneath Sector 4."

Kael looked down at the scanner in his hand. The display was erratic, glitching with interference. He tapped the side of the device. "I'm near the ridge, Mara. I can see the excavation site. It looks... wrong."

The massive machinery of the mining operation sat silent, dark silhouettes against the swirling dust. But the ground around the main drill shaft was pulsating. A rhythmic, thrumming vibration that he could feel through the soles of his boots.

"Get out of there, Kael! Protocol 7 is in effect!"

Protocol 7. Total evacuation. Containment. That meant whatever was down there wasn't just a geological anomaly. It was biological.

Suddenly, the ground erupted. A massive, chitinous limb, slick with azure fluid, burst from the earth, shattering the hardened regolith like glass. Kael stumbled back, his eyes widening in horror as the creature emerged—a monstrosity of segmented armor and mandibles, older than the planet itself.

It let out a screech that shattered his helmet's audio dampeners.

Kael scrambled for his rover, his heart hammering against his ribs. He had to warn them. The colony wasn't prepared for this. The Red Dust wasn't dead. It was merely sleeping.
